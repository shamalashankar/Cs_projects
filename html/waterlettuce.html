               <p><b>Pistia</b> is a genus of aquatic plants in the arum family, Araceae. It is the sole genus in the tribe Pistieae which reflects its systematic isolation within the family. The single species it comprises, Pistia stratiotes, is often called water cabbage, water lettuce, Nile cabbage, or shellflower. Its native distribution is uncertain but is probably pantropical; it was first discovered from the Nile near Lake Victoria in Africa</p>
               <p><font size="5"><b>Leaves:-</b></font> The leaves can measure 2 â€“ 15 cm long and are light green, with parallel venations and wavy margins. The surface of the leaves is covered in short, white hairs which form basket-like structures that can trap air bubbles and increase the plant's buoyancy. The spongy parenchyma with large intercellular spaces in the leaves also aids the plant in floating.</p>
               <p><font size="5"><b>Flower:-</b></font>The flowers are dioecious, lack petals, and are hidden in the middle of the plant amongst the leaves. Pistia stratiotes has a spadix inflorescence, containing one pistillate flower with one ovary and 2 - 8 staminate flowers with two stamens.The pistillate and carpellate flowers are separated by folds in the spathe, where the male flowers are located above the female flowers. Oval, green berries with ovoid seeds form after successful fertilization. The plant undergoes asexual reproduction by propagating through stolons, yet evidence of sexual reproduction has also been observed in the ponds of Southern Brazil</p>
