             <font size="14px"><b>INTRODUCTION :-</b></font>  <p><b>Botany</b>, branch of biology that deals with the <b>study of plants</b>, including their structure, properties, and biochemical processes. Also included are plant classification  and of interactions with the environment. The principles and findings of botany have provided the base for such applied sciences as agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.</p>
                 <p> It helps us understand why plants are so vitally important to the world. Plants start the majority of food and energy chains, they provide us with oxygen, food and medicine.Plants can be divided into two groups: <b>plants1 and plants2</b>.</p>
                 <p> Plants1 contain all photosynthetic organisms which use light, H2O, and CO2 to make organic compounds and O2. Plants1 are defined ecologically (based on their role in nature).Some plants1 can be bacteria or even animals! One example of this a green slug, Elysia chlorotica. <b>Green slugs</b> collect chloroplasts from algae and use them for their entire life as food producers. Therefore, green slugs are both animals and plants</p>
                <p>Plants2 are all <b>organisms from Vegetabilia kingdom</b>. Normally, plants2 are green organisms with a stem and leaves. We can define them also as <b>multi-tissued, primarily terrestrial and photosynthetic eukaryotes</b>. This definition is taxonomical.</p>
