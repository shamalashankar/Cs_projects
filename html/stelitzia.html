             <p><b>Strelitzia reginae</b>, commonly known as the crane flower, bird of paradise, or isigude in Nguni, is a species of flowering plant indigenous to South Africa. An evergreen perennial, it is widely cultivated for its dramatic flowers. In temperate areas it is a popular houseplant</p><p><font size="5"><b>leaves:-</b></font>Leaves entire, simple, opposite, narrowly ovate, attenuate (becoming thinner) at base, acuminate (tapering to a point) at apex, waxy, up to 15 cm long and 6 cm wide, dark green, suffused with silver and purple irregular margins; petioles maroon to magenta, about 1 to 2 cm long.</p>
            <p>The plant grows to 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) tall, with large, strong leaves 25–70 cm (10–28 in) long and 10–30 cm (4–12 in) broad, produced on petioles up to 1 m (40 in) long. The leaves are evergreen and arranged in two ranks, making a fan-shaped crown..</p>
             <p><font size="5"><b>Flowers:-</b></font>  The flowers stand above the foliage at the tips of long stalks. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges is termed the spathe. This is placed perpendicular to the stem, which gives it the appearance of a bird's head and beak; it makes a durable perch for holding the sunbirds which pollinate the flowers. The flowers, which emerge one at a time from the spathe, consist of three orange sepals and three purplish-blue or white petals. Two of the petals are joined together to form an arrow-like nectary. When the sunbirds sit to drink the nectar, the third petal opens to release the anther and cover their feet in pollen</p>
