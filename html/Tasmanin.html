           <p><b>Dianella tasmanica,</b> commonly known as the "Tasman flax-lily or Tasmanian flax-lily".Dianella tasmanica is a strappy herbaceous plant which grows to 0.5–2 metres (1–7 ft) high and wide, with a thick spreading rhizome under the ground. The green linear keeled leaves have finely toothed margins, and may reach 1 m (40 in) in length and 1.5–4 cm wide. The small (1.5 cm diameter) blue flowers bloom in spring and summer (August to February), and are followed by small roughly oval or globular violet berries which range from about 1.2 cm (0.5 in) in diameter.</p>
