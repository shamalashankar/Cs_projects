                  <p><b>Clitoria ternatea</b>, commonly known as <b>"Asian pigeonwings", "bluebellvine", "blue pea", "butterfly pea", "cordofan pea" or "Darwin pea"</b> is a plant species belonging to the family <b>Fabaceae,</b> endemic and native to the Indonesian island of Ternate.
                     In India, it is revered as a holy flower, used in daily puja rituals
                   </p>
                  <p>It is a <b>perennial herbaceous</b> plant, with elliptic, obtuse leaves. It grows as a vine or creeper, doing well in moist, neutral soil. Its most striking feature is the color of its flowers, a vivid deep blue; solitary, with light yellow markings. They are about 4 cm (1+1/2 in) long by 3 cm (1+1/4 in) wide. Some varieties yield white flowers.
                  </p><p>
                   The fruits are 5-7 cm (2-2+3/4 in) long, flat pods with six to ten seeds in each pod. They are edible when tender.
                   It is grown as an ornamental plant and as a revegetation species (e.g., in coal mines in Australia), requiring little care when cultivated. As a <b>legume</b>, its roots form a symbiotic association with soil bacteria known as <b>rhizobia</b>, which transform atmospheric N2 into a plant-usable form (a process called nitrogen fixing), therefore, this plant is also used to improve soil quality through the decomposition of nitrogen rich plant material.
