            <p> <b> Ravenala</b> is a genus of "monocotyledonous" flowering plants. Classically, the genus was considered to include a single species, Ravenala madagascariensis, commonly known as the traveller's tree, traveller's palm or East-West palm, from Madagascar. It is not a true palm (family Arecaceae) but a member of the family <b>Strelitziaceae</b>. The genus is closely related to the southern African genus <b>Strelitzia</b> and the South American genus<b>Phenakospermum</b>
            </p>
            <p>The scientific name Ravenala comes from Malagasy ravinala or ravina ala meaning "forest leaves".</p>
            <p>The enormous paddle-shaped leaves are borne on long petioles, in a distinctive fan shape aligned in a single plane (distichous). The large white flowers are structurally similar to those of its relatives, the bird-of-paradise flowers Strelitzia reginae and Strelitzia nicolai, but are generally considered less attractive, with a green bract
                       These flowers, upon being pollinated, produce brilliant blue seeds. In tropical and subtropical regions, the plant is widely cultivated for its distinctive habit and foliage. As the plant grows older, it progressively loses the lowest or oldest leaves and reveals a sturdy grey trunk. Of the four forms, varieties or subspecies, the largest is the "Bemavo", from the hills of eastern Madagascar, which can be 100 feet (30 metres) in height with a trunk 2 feet (60 cm) thick.[9] The foliar fan consists of 30 to 45 leaves for mature specimens, each as much as 36 feet (11  metres) in length.
