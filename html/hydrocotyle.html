            <p>Hydrocotyle verticillata, also known as <b>whorled pennywort, whorled marshpennywort or shield pennywort</b>, is a flowering plant found in South and North America and the West Indies. Its creeping habit and unusual leaves give it its common names. It grows in places that are marshy, boggy, or even wet.</p>
            <p>Hydrocotyle verticillata is characterized by itâ€™s stunted growth, creeping in nature and umbrella-like leaves that bear a striking resemblance to mushrooms and green toadstools. It is, therefore, best suited as a foreground plant in aquariums. A runner plant by nature, it exhibits a similar growth pattern even when submersed. It grows to a maximum of 1- 4 cm in height.</p>
