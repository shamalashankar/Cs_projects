            <p>Dieffenbachia amoena (dumbcane) is a monocot which is commonly cultivated as a houseplant, for its decorative leaves. It is a very popular and hardy shade-loving plant. Its leaves are large, oblong, and cream or light yellow with deep green spots and stripes in bands along the veins and border.
               Dieffenbachia amoena can be propagated by tip and nodal cuttings. It can attain a height of 6 feet in favourable condition. It likes high humidity and a draft-free atmosphere. It should not be placed in front of an air-conditioner unit or fan. After watering its leaf becomes straight and brittle. So if transportation is required, stop watering for a few days, to prevent the leaves from breaking.

            <p>Leopard lily is an erect, broadleaf evergreen, perennial in the Araceae (arum) family that is native to Central and South America. The common name dumbcane comes from its ill effects on the vocal cords if ingested. 
            </p><p>
              Plant it in a loose, fertile, high organic soil and provide indirect light, and high humidity. Water the plant thoroughly, then allow the top 1 inch surface of the soil to dry completely before watering again to prevent root rot. Propagate by division or stem cutting.
