               <p><b>Thuja </b>is a genus of coniferous tree or shrub in the<b> Cupressaceae (cypress family)</b>. There are five species in the genus, two native to North America and three native to eastern Asia.The genus is <b>monophyletic</b> and sister to Thujopsis.  commonly known as arborvitaes (from the Latin term for 'tree of life'), <b>thujas or cedars</b>.Thuja are evergreen trees growing from 10 to 200 feet (3 to 61 metres) tall, with stringy-textured reddish-brown bark. The shoots are flat, with side shoots only in a single plane.</p> 
               </p>     
               <p><font size="5"><b>Leaves:-</b></font> The leaves are arranged in flattened fan shaped groupings with resin-glands, and oppositely grouped in 4 ranks. The mature leaves are different from younger leaves, with those on larger branchlets having sharp, erect, free apices. The leaves on flattened lateral branchlets are crowded into appressed groups and scale-like and the lateral pairs are keeled. With the exception of T. plicata, the lateral leaves are shorter than the facial leaves.The<b> male</b> cones are small, inconspicuous, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The <b>female</b> cones start out similarly inconspicuous, but grow to about 1 to 2 cm (0.39 to 0.79 in) long at maturity when 6–8 months old; they have 6-12 overlapping, thin, leathery scales, each scale bearing 1–2 small seeds with a pair of narrow lateral wings.

               <font size="5"><b>Flower:-</b></font> The solitary <b>flowers</b> are produced terminally. Pollen cones with 2-6 pairs of 2-4 pollen sacked sporophylls.<b>Seed </b>cones are <b>ellipsoid</b>, typically 9 to 14 mm (0.35 to 0.55 in) long, and mature and open the first year. The thin woody cone scales number from 4-6 pairs and are persistent and overlapping, with an oblong shape, they are also basifixed. The central 2-3 pairs of cone scales are fertile. The seed cones produce 1 to 3 seeds per scale, the seeds are lenticular in shape and equally 2 winged. Seedlings produce <b>2 cotyledons</b>.
